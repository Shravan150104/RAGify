  "summary": " 1. Minneapolis is set to become the first major U.S. city to end single family home zoning, a move aimed at addressing issues of segregation, high housing costs, and sprawl that have persisted over the past century.\n2. The change in Minneapolis was led by a comprehensive planning process within their planning department, involving significant community outreach and a desire for large-scale, dramatic change.\n3. In San Francisco, while single family zoning has historically kept people out of certain neighborhoods, a majority of single-family home ownership is now non-white in many neighborhoods. However, the city's lot sizes are smaller compared to other cities, posing different challenges for densification.\n4. The discussion on housing and potential changes in San Francisco should consider what other cities are doing or what distinguishes them from other cities.\n5. Commissioners expressed support for exploring broader, larger-scale changes in San Francisco's housing policy, recognizing the unique constraints and opportunities presented by the city's topography, history, and lot sizes.",

      "question": "what did they talk about zoning",
      "answer": " They discussed the issue of zoning, specifically focusing on the concern about restrictive zoning that has historically contributed to segregation, high housing costs, and urban sprawl. More specifically, it was proposed to end single-family home zoning, which has been a significant factor in entrenching these issues over the past century. Additionally, they mentioned that restrictive zoning laws have been used to keep certain minorities from moving into specific neighborhoods, and this issue persists today. The conversation revolves around the idea of abolishing or mending such restrictive zoning policies as part of a larger consensus in the city.\n\n[31.0 \u2013 46.0, 65.0 \u2013 88.0]"
