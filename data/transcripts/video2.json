{"text": " community animals as you call them. Dr. Harsh Dhaiya, would you want to come in? Advocate Harsh Dhaiya, would you want to come in here? Lavanya is saying, look, there is nothing to say. You know, the point is that what Bangalore and the BBMC doing is backed by science. You feed the dogs, their aggression comes down, dog bites come down. But is it even a good idea to be feeding dogs on the streets of any city? Forget Bangalore. Shriya Ji, this is not just a political issue, but this is a big social issue. And also there is a big philosophical question that occurs in this particular debate. You know, when I was listening to Lavanya Ji, I was noting something down and, you know, I'll come to that. You know, what I was thinking, I was thinking of a beautiful quote that says morality also has aesthetic standards. If you kill a cockroach, you are a hero. But if you kill a butterfly, you are a villain. Same applies to this particular case as well, that those people who eat non-wish day and night and, you know, politically motivated, some of them are politically motivated and they go as far as promoting beef that, you know, more and more people should eat beef. They suddenly become dog lovers when it comes to the cases of feeding stray dogs. I don't understand when Lavanya Ji was also saying that these dogs will be fed eggs and chickens. How are dogs more important than chickens? If animals are, we have to be compassionate with animals, then that compassion should extend to all the animals, not just one particular, you know, section of animals, which is dogs or cats. Why should that compassion not extend to all animals? And see, this is more of a social issue. When a kid goes out of his house and he's scared to step out in the park because I've seen that in my area as well. I live in Delhi and there are in my area itself, which is considered to be a posh area, but people are so scared of these stray dogs that the kids have stopped going to the parks. We have raised those issues with the RW as well. We have raised those issues with the local administration as well, with the police authorities as well. And these dog lovers always come to protect these stray dogs. See, nobody, I don't think anyone in this debate or anyone in the Indian society would be against stray dogs per se. But the major focus of ours should be that how do we sterilize them? How do we control their population? And how do we give them better living conditions? And the better living conditions like Karthi Chitambaram from Congress, I really look up to him for this particular matter that, you know, he raises these stray dog issues quite a lot. He has raised this issue in parliament as well. And like you mentioned, he said a beautiful thing. Stray dogs do not belong to the streets. These dogs belong to houses. Either someone should adopt them or either there should be community housing for these dogs where they, all of them can be housed, they can be taken care of and they can be sterilized. Because ultimately the human life is more important, should be more important for the government and the administration. Okay, so Lavanya Balal, one of your own MPs, Mr. Karthi Chitambaram from neighboring Tamil Nadu is saying, this looks like a terrible idea. Because streets are not the place that dogs should be roaming around in. And it creates a dangerous, a hazardous situation for public health, for citizens of that city. Shreya, if I may complete, what I was saying that time is, yes, Harsh made a point about, oh, do you not have compassion? I mean, I understand from his statement, compassion towards chicken and eggs. Mr. Harsh, I'm a Jane. I do not eat any kind of non-wage food. I do not eat onion and garlic, but I do understand a huge chunk of this population in India eats all of this. And I will accept that. We have to accept dogs are not herbivorous. They are carnivorous animals. So they will eat whatever they are supposed to eat. They need to have their protein. While you and Mr. Karthi Chitambaram, whom I respectfully disagree with, I really like him. I look up to him, but I will disagree with him when he says the dog's place is in a shelter home. What I would like to ask every Indian today, Shreya, is, you know, if you look at BBMP, it has a great vaccination program. It has a great sterilization program happening in Bengaluru. It is a second richest corporation in India. It is doing everything possible to be all inclusive of these animals. I agree. The place for these dogs are not the streets. It is the homes. How many Indians adopt these stray dogs? Zero. Or less than 1% Indians adopt these Indy dogs. No, then, Lavanya, the point is, since, you know, since the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister and everyone in the Congress has such bleeding, you know, their hearts are bleeding for street dogs. Let them begin. Let them start adopting dogs. They certainly live in big enough houses. We all live in chota-chota flats. Yes, I agree with you. Let them start. I agree with you. Let them show the way. All of them should adopt it, Shreya. I agree with you. I think this is something I'm going to carry to my CM and Deputy CM and all the Ministers and tell them, you should adopt Indy dogs as well. Okay. I request every Indian to do that and to be more compassionate. Anand Ji, if the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka adopt Indies, will you stop criticizing them and say, okay, we are doing the same? See, this is not about individuals saying, I eat this, I don't eat this, I accept this. This is not about individuals or the CM, you know, taking two dogs into his home. Now, that's not that thing. What I'm speaking about is at the administrative level, you're spending public money. Use it cautiously. Have a proper intent and execute it. And I'm sure Congress doesn't understand this. And it has been proven in many debates and it's proven now also. They are just, you know, throwing emotional stuff to people so that people catch on to something till the next news comes. And I have been proven right in this debate also. Because they don't have the intent. They don't have the intent of solving the society's problems. Because they don't have an execution plan only. They just want to grab some money. That's all. And please go to the next person. Sreya, I would like to say that we see an issue and we try to resolve it from Congress. We are not emotive. It is the BJP, I would like to remind the world, it is the BJP's medical minister who made money out of people's misery during COVID by double billing everything who is under investigation right now. So, let not preach to us about being, you know, about framing policies that is going to help the people. You know, Lavanya Malal, but questions will be asked about misplaced priorities. Are humans priority or are animal priorities, priority? You know, that is also a question that will be asked. Because in universities, you say you don't have money to pay pensions. More than half the Indira canteens in Bangalore have shut shop because there is no money to run them. So, you don't have money for all of this. You don't have money to pay lorry drivers who actually supply you with grain for the Annabhagya scheme. So, on one hand you say no money, then three crore rupees you will spend here. People will ask questions. Anyway, let me get to Tamna. Here we go.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.58, "text": " community animals as you call them.
